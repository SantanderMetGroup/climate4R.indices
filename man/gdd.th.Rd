\usage{
gdd.th(tm, tb = 5, cth = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tm}{Vector with mean temperature data}

\item{tb}{Threshold value for Tbase (Defalut is 5ยบ)}

\item{cth}{Ceiling threshold over which the sum of growing degrees is 0. If NULL (default) this threshold is not applied.}
}
\description{
Accumulated sum of the difference between daily mean temperature and the threshold (when higher than the threshold) 
over the primary growing season for mid-latitude agricultural areas in the northern Hemisphere (April-September).
